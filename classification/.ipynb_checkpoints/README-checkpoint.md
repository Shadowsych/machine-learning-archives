# Classification Models
Use classification to predict the category of a data point.

### Example of a Classification Problem
Let's give a simple Binary Classifiation problem: we want to classify if an image is of a Dog or a Cat.

We can look at multiple factors that distinguish a Dog from a Cat:
- Pointiness of ears
- Snout length
- Eye width
- etc.

These features (independent variables) can help us classify the image in the classification model.
