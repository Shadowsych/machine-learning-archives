    "### When To Use?\n",
    "Logistic Regression is best used when an independent variable's values less/greater than a threshold predicts \"0\", and greater/less than the threshold predicts \"1\".\n",
    "- Basically, the classification switches from \"0\" to \"1\" if the independent variable's values pass a threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "There can also be multiple independent variables, and they each have their independent thresholds."

    "For less aged people, more data points land on 0 (No). For older aged people, more data points land on 1 (Yes).\n",
