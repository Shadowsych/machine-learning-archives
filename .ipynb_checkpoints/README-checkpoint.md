# Machine Learning References
A separate repository from my archives that contains all my machine learning studies and references.  

# Anaconda
Anaconda is a Python/R Data Science platform that automates many of the complicated tasks to set-up data science projects.
- https://www.anaconda.com/

Install Anaconda for your computer, and then set-up virtual environments (VMs) for projects that need specific dependencies.
- Anaconda comes with pre-installed dependencies for the ```root``` virtual environment such as scipy, jupyter, etc.

# Requirement
Before going through this archive, it's important to understand data analysis and manipulating data for ML models.
