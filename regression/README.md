# Regression Models
Use regression analysis to describe the relationships between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable.

We can use training data to train a regression model to approximate a predicted value.

### Example of a Regression Problem
Let's say we want to predict the salary of a person based on age.

We can model age (independent variable) over salary (dependent variable) by fitting it through a regression model.

Once we fit the data set through the model, we can predict the amount of salary a person earns based on age.
