# Regression Models
Use regression analysis to describe the relationships between a set of independent variables and a continous dependent variable.
- Continous Variable: A variable that has an infinite number of values.

Regression analysis produces a regression equation where the coefficients (b0, b1, b2, etc.) represent the relationship
between each independent variable and the continous dependent variable.

Basically, use a regression equation to make predictions by plugging-in independent values to get a dependent value.
