# Regression Models
Use regression analysis to describe the relationships between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable.

We can use training data to train a regression model to approximate a predicted value.
- Continous models use an equation to predict a y-value
- Non-continous models use data structures (such as Decision Trees) to predict a y-value
