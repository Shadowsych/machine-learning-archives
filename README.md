# Supervised vs Unsupervised Models
Supervised Learning uses input labels to learn and predict an output.  
- The main concerns are model complexity and the bias-variance trade-off

Unsupervised Learning learns the inherent structure of the data set without using labels.
- The main concerns are exploratory analysis and dimensionality reduction
