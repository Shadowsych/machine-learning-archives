# Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing is the interactions between computers and human languages.

In NLP, you analyze large amounts of natural langauge data to determine trends between them.
- Ex: Classify each positive or negative reviews in a list of 100 reviews

These large amounts of natural language datas are referred to as a "corpus" in NLP.

### NLP Libraries
1. Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)  
2. SpaCy  
3. Standford NLP  
4. OpenNLP

The most popular is NLTK, so we're going to use that for building NLP models.
