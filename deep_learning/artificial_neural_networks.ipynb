    "The fundamental neural network to deep learning. We will create a simple Dense ANN using Keras in this lecture, but first let's learn about the essential mechanisms of an artificial neural network.\n",

    "### Non-Neural Network Learning\n",
    "When not using a neural network, then you just using a bunch of if statements to check if certain conditions are true then it helps determine a predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, classifying an animal as a dog or cat. We would use if statements to check if the animal's ears are pointy or lopped, snout is small or large, etc.\n",

    "When using a neural network, you program the network's architecture then it'll determine the necessary characteristics itself.\n",

    "The input value(s) are transmitted through neuron(s), which are processed throughout the layers to determine output value(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, the input values of a human are the 5 senses: sight, touch, sound, taste, and smell. And these input values are transmitted to the neurons, which the neurons will process and determine an output. For example, if I touch a fire with my hand, then my touch input value will signal the neuron, and then the neuron will process it and determine that I need to take my hand away from the fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weights\n",
    "For each synapse (signal), there can be weights to measure the significance of a signal. Weights are crucial, and they're the values that get adjusted across the neural network. This is where gradient descent and backpropagation come into play, but we'll get to that later.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ann/basic_neural_network.png\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "This neural network is very basic: there are only independent variables (input layer), parameter tuning variables (weights), and a dependent variable (output layer). This is actually how most machine learning models work if there is no deep learning involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, in deep learning, there are \"hidden\" layers that increase the accuracy of the model. A \"hidden\" layer is any layer in-between the input and output layers of the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Neural Network\n",
    "A deep neural network has \"hidden\" layers that process the input values further. Let's assume a neural network has already been trained, so let's observe how it will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network below is trying to predict the price of a house based on area, bedrooms, distance to city, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ann/neural_network_house_price.png\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron in the hidden layer only accepts only some input values because of the weights from the synapses (signals) to calculate whether or not a signal is significant enough for the neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the middle neuron in the hidden layer focuses on only the \"Area\", \"Bedrooms\", and \"Age\" input values. Maybe because the already trained neuron determined that younger people prefer high area and lots of bedrooms, so only those neurons are significant enough to impact the middle neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is the last neuron in the hidden layer that focuses on only the \"Age\". Maybe because the neuron determined that a house older than 100+ years is priced significantly higher due to historical reasons. This is a good example of when to use the rectifier activiation function because the neuron would check if the age is 100+ then the neuron's contribution to the output increases and if not then the neuron's contribution to the output is 0.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "However, too many epochs may cause overfitting of the data set. It means that your model does not learn the data, it memorizes the data. To avoid overfitting, early stop the model once the validation accuracy flattens out, or it starts decreasing."
