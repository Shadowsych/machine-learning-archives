    "For each synapse (signal), there can be weights to measure the significance of a signal. Weights are crucial, and they're the values that get adjusted across the neural network. This is where gradient descent and backpropagation come into play, but we'll get to that later.\n",

    "\n",
    "The mathematics inside the neuron is a value that determines whether or not to pass the signal to the next neuron in the next layer. This value is determined through an activation that is applied on the weighted sum of the input values."
