# Deep Learning
Machine learning usnig ANNs (artificial neural networks). It mimics how the human brain operates using artificial neural networks to learn and adapt based on provided input data.

### Artificial Neural Network
Each neuron is called a "node" and each column is called a "layer". The neurons are connected to another layer's neurons, and so on and so forth thus creating a "network" of neurons.

ANNs are the basic idea of neural networks in deep learning. It's essential to learn them as a pre-requisite to learn other types of neural networks.
