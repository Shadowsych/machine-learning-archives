# Pre-Processing
Pre-Processing is needed to clean the data set before we fit it into a statistical model.

### Few Methods of Pre-Processing
1. Encoding Categorical Variables
2. Feature Selection (Dimensionality Reduction)
    - Technique to select certain features (independent variables) in a model
        - Removing features with missing values (or replacing their values with the mean)
        - Removing features with low variance
        - Removing features that are highly correlated to other features
        - Removing features that accept a null hypothesis
        - And many others!
3. Feature Extraction (Dimensionality Reduction)
4. Splitting Training and Testing Sets
5. Feature Scaling

And many others!
