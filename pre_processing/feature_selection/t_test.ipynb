    "# T-Test\n",
    "A t-test is a statistical test used to determine the significant difference between the means (averages) of two groups, which may be related to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Is a T-Test Useful?\n",
    "Let's give a scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "100 students in class A scored an average of 85% with a standard deviation of 3%.  \n",
    "100 students in class B scored an average of 87% with a standard deviation of 4%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we CANNOT immediately conclude that class B is smarter than A. \n",
    "- This is because, along with the mean (average), the standard deviation of class B is also higher than class A\n",
    "    - This indicates that the extreme percentage for class B spread-out more than the extreme percentages for class A\n",
    "    \n",
    "We can use a t-test to determine if it's statistically reasonable to conclude that class B is smarter than class A based on the mean and standard deviation. "
