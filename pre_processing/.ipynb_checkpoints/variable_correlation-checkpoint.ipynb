    "# Variable Correlation\n",
    "We can calculate if variables are highly or lowly correlated with each other.\n",
    "### Calculate Correlation Coefficients\n",
    "In order to determine how correlated variables are to each other, we can calculate their correlation coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation Coefficients Range From -1 to 1:  \n",
    "1. If two variables have a negative coeff, then they're negatively correlated.\n",
    "    - If two variables have a coeff of -1, the they're perfectly negative multi-collinear.  \n",
    "2. If two variables have a positive coeff, then they're positively correlated.\n",
    "    - If two variables have a coeff of 1, then they're perfectly positive multi-collinear.  \n",
    "3. If two variables have a coeff of 0, then they have no linear correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a correlation matrix to help us observe the correlation between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem With Perfect Multi-Collinarity\n",
    "Perfect multicollinearity skews with the coefficient estimates for a machine learning model. This is beause there becomes an infinite number of equally \"good\" solutions, so there's no way to tell which solution is the actual best for the model.\n",
    "- For instance, in the OLS Regression models, the least-squares error is minimized equally well, thus there's an inifinite number of equally \"good\" solutions for the algorithm\n",
    "- The goal is to get a a unique, best, solution; not an infinite number of solutions!\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to an unstable model with high variance of predicted values. If we attempt to predict a value, that value would be produce a large change in the prediction due to such high variance.\n",
    "- It becomes difficult to determine a \"precise\" prediction since there are so many variations"
