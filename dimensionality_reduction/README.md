# Dimensionality Reduction Models
Dimensionality Reduction models reduce the number of independent variables to simplify your data set. Dimensionality reduction is also called a "feature extraction" technique because dimensionality reduction extracts new independent variables from the data in the old independent variables.

# Model Selection
### Unsupervised Learning
- PCA
    - When you don't know the classifications (labels) of the samples

### Supervised Learning
- LDA
